The intention of compiling this project is to study and to visualize the effect of various factors
on each other. These factors are related to the app downloads on the Google play store. We also try to build a linear model which would be able to predict the effect of one variable on the outcome of another. Through this predictive model we also try to find the relation between the two chosen variables. The two chosen variables here are Ratings of the apps and the number of Reviews made by the user. The broad objectives are:
1. Categorize apps based on their popularity.
2. To conclude which kind of apps have the highest revenue.
3. Categorize the number of downloads in each genre of apps.
4. To find, if there is a relation between the number of app reviews and their ratings.
